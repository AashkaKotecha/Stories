It's a Tuesday morning and Iqbal is all set 
Khaki uniform, silk scarf and a spotless black Taxi
It's a Tuesday morning and Radha is all glammed up
Green chiffon, golden jhumkas, blue bindi, and a couple of banglesÂ 

Iqbal flaunts his salt-and-pepper beard,
runs his fingers through the whites in his hair
and stops his taxi just around the corner of her home.

Radha walks up to him, opens the taxi door
grabs a seat and puts a hold :
On her snowy, long white locks,
On Iqbals fast beating heart

"Aisi ulji nazar unsey hatt -ti nahi
daant se reshami dor katt -ti nahi"

She shuts the door to wake up Iqbal;
from a dream that his poor old heart braved every night
The one, where he drives his Radha in his Taxi
and brings them home, his home, 
like the birds flocking together back to their nest

Radha doesn't say a word
No.
Not through those rosy lips
But she whispers through those bangles wrapped around her wrinkled wrists
Her graying eyebrows dancing to exclamation
Her eyelashes resting as she blushes
And Iqbal witnesses the Sunrise of his lifetime!


"Kisko pata tha pehlu main rakha dil aisa paaji bhi hoga
Hum to hamesha samajtey they koi hum jaisa haanji hi hoga"

The wind gets naughty through the window
Radha's strand of hair flutters across the creases of her cheeks
Iqbal clutches the steering and his throbbing heart
as their eyes greet and meet through the rear view mirror!
The honks and horns on the street are the new age violins
The shedding tree leaves on the car window, their new age bouquet

Iqbal stops his car outside the mandir and Radha walks out
With a pallu covering her hair
With a chant and wish covering her lips
With age pacing up and her walk slowing down
She leaves behind a piece of heart with Iqbal 
and stands at the entrance of the mandir

"Aisi udaasi baithi hai dil pe Hasney se ghabra rahe hai
Saari jawani katra k kaati, Piri me takra gaye hai"

The mandir bells jingle and mingle with the azaan call from a mosque in the next lane
Iqbal kneels on a white handkerchief
Radha kneels on the white marble
The whites in their hair touched by the same air
Their heart swinging to the tune of bell and azaan
Their lips chanting Love
Their eyes dreaming of being Loved
Their heads bowed down in unison

Tuesdays are indeed God's favorite day to kabool Love!!!

"Iss umra mein abb khaogey dhokey
Darr lagta hai ishq karne mein ji
Dil to bacha hai ji"
