I run my fingers through your hair
let my fingertips go for a stroll on your forhead
I am forging my  name with an invisible ink there, you see (may be you don't)

You run your fingers through my curls
let your fingertips go for a stroll on my nape
You are forging your nail marks with a visible scar there, you don't see (may be you should)

We are screaming together into the darkness of this night
You are letting out the pain that has been holding you
I am letting out the pain of being held by you

Our fingers are now authors of different stories
Mine with a story of survival
Yours with a saga of destruction

My fingers have now curled up into each other
They talk about mercy and prayers
Your fingers have now curled up against a knife
They talk about hunger and curses


Longing and Belonging
Begging and Banging
Cries and Screams

Finger by finger, I count the last breaths
as your fingers work their magic through my veins
while the knife dances along

The story is about to end now
any minute
with your breath held in anger
with my breath held in despair
I wait for your fingers to bring in the climax

My nape, your fingers, a canvas in red
Your forhead, my fingers, a fate to be read...
