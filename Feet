//Feet

There's a gaint garden swing in the backyard
I grab a seat, let my hair loose
hold on to the sides tightly, as if holding onto the collars of your shirt
firm and strong.

My lips are exhausted,
rather parched for words 
so I let my feet do the talking 

push-pull-sudden-stop
tap the forefoot and running away
kick the heels and bringing me home

painted toe-nails,
cracked heels, 
thorn scratched skin 
yet ornamented with the payal around my ankle

Broken and beautiful, the feet decided to raise me above the ground
let me soar to the skies for a moment
let my hair battle the wind
let the pallu of my sari drop till I drop my fears

Left and right,
Right and left
One foot forward, One foot backward
Swinging me above the ground
Dragging me down and crushing me into the ground
Raising my heartbeats until the blood rushes into my ears
Numbing me until there's only fears

Oh the resemblance my feet have with your love language
Broken and Beautiful indeed!!!
