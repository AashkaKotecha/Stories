It's 5 PM and Samar is bound;
To his chair, to his chai and to his ritual of listening to radio with chai on his chair
The wind today is particulary sharp,
more like a slap rather than a pat !!
The chai is kadak like always and the chair creeks with the same ache
Samar tunes the radio frequency to this particular one
As if the coordinates of the radio frequency resembles the coordinates of Meera's existence
The radio now starts humming and Meera's absence is suddenly wiped out
"Jhonkha hawa ka aaj bhi zulfein udata hoga na
Tera dupatta aaj bhi tere sir se sarakta hoga na"

Chances and choices took Meera to a far away world
somewhere across the seven oceans 
but Samar was still here, bound,
to his chair, chai, radio and to his Meera
He would religiously dress her, in his memories,
in her favorite kesari duppata each evening 
as the wind would add to the struggles of keeping that duppatta tucked to her long locks

Meera was always free, wild like that wind;
that acts like a slap rather than a pat
but even the wildest flowers, when tucked behind ears,
would melt the autumn away.
"Baalon mein tere aaj bhi phool koi sajta hoga na
Jhonkha hawa ka aaj bhi zulfein udata hoga na"




Thandi hawayein raaton mein tujko thapkiyan deti hogi na
Chand ki thandak khwaabon mein tujko leke jagti hogi na



Mere khayalo mein sanam khud se bhi baatein karti hogi na
main dekhta hu chup chup k tumko 
mehsoos karti hogi na


hanstey hanstey aankhein tumhari bhar bhar aati hogi na
mujko dhaka tha dhoop mein  jissey woh anchal bhigoti hogi na



ek ek meri baatein tumko yaad to aati hogi na
jhonka hawa ka aaj bhi zulfein udata hoga na
































Samar decides to pen a letter today
He wants to ink out how wild it feels to be bound to a chair, a ritual
yet how safe it would be to sail across the unknown oceans
only if they lead him to his Meera
He hasn't spoken a syllable about her absence
but the meer thought of Meera's presence, makes him want to write a chapter today.
